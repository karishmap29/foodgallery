    <p>Musk-owned Twitter has instructed workers not to report to work as all office buildings will be temporarily shut,
        beginning immediately.

        According to BBC, a message sent to Twitter employees highlights that access to all office buildings and badge
        access will be revoked until Monday, November 21.

        The report comes a couple of days after Twitter head honcho Elon Musk asked workers to do “extremely hardcore”
        work or leave the micro-blogging site.

        “This will mean working long hours at high intensity. Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing
        grade,” Musk said.

        “Please continue to comply with company policy by refraining from discussing confidential company information on
        social media, with the press or elsewhere,” Twitter further said.</p>
